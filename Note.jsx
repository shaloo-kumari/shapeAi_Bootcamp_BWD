      <h1>Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
      <p>
        Object-oriented programming (OOP) is at the core of Java. In fact, all
        Java programs are to at least some extent object-oriented. OOP is so
        integral to Java that it is best to understand its basic principles
        before you begin writing even simple Java programs. Therefore, this
        chapter begins with a discussion of the theoretical aspects of OOP.
